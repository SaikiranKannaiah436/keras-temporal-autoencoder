## Temporal Autoencoders
![]()

This is a collection of Keras wrappers for Autoencoders with application to synthetic time series data samples from a Hidden Markov Model.

Temporal Autoencoders can be used for timeseries dimensionality reduction. The special thing about the example: all linear methods (e.g. PCA and TICA) as well as commonly used nonlinear methods (e.g. Kernel PCA) will inevitably fail on our dataset.

Why is this? Linear methods will fail, since the used trajectory is generated by nonlinear embedding. Commonly used variance based nonlinear methods such as Kernel PCA will also fail on our dataset, since they search for "nonlinear directions" of maximal variance, but here the variance will not yield any insight on the classification of metastable states. We are interested in the nonlinear directions of slow processes, so to speak.

This means that we will need a nonlinear method that does not consider variance of a stationary problem, but autocovariance at a lag time of our assumed stochastic process. In a linear setting, this is done by ττ-timelagging our data and doing component analysis for the resulting estimated autocovariance matrix (TICA). This idea can now be incorporated into the fitting of an autoencoder: we will simply use timelagged observation pairs $x(t),x(t+τ)x(t),x(t+τ)$ for the training of an autoencoder.

We will implement a short HMM routine to generate our trajectory and visualize the resulting data.
